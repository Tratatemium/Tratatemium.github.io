## About
This webpage serves as a portfolio to highlight my journey as a front-end developer. It includes:
- An introduction to who I am and my background.
- A showcase of my projects with descriptions and images.
- A section dedicated to my hobbies, including woodworking and cooking.

## Features
- **Responsive Design**: Optimized for various screen sizes, from desktop to mobile.
- **Dark/Light Mode**: Toggle between themes using the accessible switch in the top-left corner.
- **Interactive Animations**: Smooth animations for elements appearing on scroll.
- **Lightbox Gallery**: View images in a full-screen lightbox with captions and keyboard navigation.
- **Accessible Navigation**: ARIA labels, semantic HTML, and keyboard-friendly interactions.
- **Performance Optimizations**: Lazy loading for images and preloading critical assets.

---

## Accessibility
This project is designed with accessibility in mind:
- **Keyboard Navigation**: All interactive elements (e.g., links, buttons, images) are focusable and operable via `Tab` and `Enter`.
- **ARIA Labels**: Descriptive ARIA labels are added to improve screen reader support.
- **Color Contrast**: The color scheme is tested to meet WCAG AA standards for text and background contrast.
- **Focus Styles**: Visible focus outlines are provided for all focusable elements.
- **Skip Navigation**: A "Skip to content" link allows users to bypass navigation and jump directly to the main content.

---

## Technologies Used
- **HTML5**: Semantic structure and accessibility.
- **CSS3**: Custom animations, responsive design, and theming.
- **JavaScript (ES6)**: Interactive features like the lightbox and theme toggle.
- **Google Fonts**: Typography using the "Fira Sans" font family.
